Hello, my name is Robyn originally from Florida but living in Indiana now and I am a Mom of 6 adult children and a Grammy of 6. I am a divorced, former military spouse and I am looking to have a career in something I enjoy and not just a job so I can feel good at the end of the day and also have a career where I can afford to take vacations on my own and travel to see family and take go on vacays with them too. I have just over a year of college and a certificate in Electronic Medical records.
